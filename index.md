description: Hi, I'm Chaz. I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Georgetown University Medical Center. My research explores differential metabolic fluxes in pancreatic cancer compared to the normal pancreas. Combing a variety of analytical metabolomics techniques (UPLC-MS, GC-MS and NMR) with molecular biology and cell biology techniques, my goal is to identify early metabolic markers of pancreatic disease and/or novel therapeutic targets. Additionally, I work on developing new software tools for metabolomics analysis (with my very smart colleagues). On this site, I will share my current research projects, recent publications, software development efforts and occasionally, investment ideas - I'm passionate about supporting start-up biotech companies and performing scientific review of their fledgling technologies is a hobby of mine.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about me, my research or would like to collaborate!
